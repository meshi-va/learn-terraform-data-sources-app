# Learn Terraform data sources | APP repository

I forked this repo in order to complete [this tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/data-sources?in=terraform/certification-associate-tutorials) which is part of the [Terraform Associate Tutorial List](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/certification-associate-tutorials).

This repo relies on [meshi-va/learn-terraform-data-sources-vpc](https://github.com/meshi-va/learn-terraform-data-sources-vpc), hence it should be only used with `terraform apply` once the configuration in the previously mentioned repo is applied.
